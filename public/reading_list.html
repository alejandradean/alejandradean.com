          <h1>What I'm Currently Reading</h1>
          <h5>...or books I think you should read, too.</h5>
          <img id="book" src="book_icon.gif" alt="Tiny Book">
          <p>Put simply, my favorite stories take place on other planets, in medieval realms, or in haunted houses. In other words, the genres I gravitate most towards are science fiction, fantasy, and gothic horror. I've read the Lord of the Rings trilogy twice (I also happen to have a Tolkien drawing tattooed on my arm), and I've read every piece of fiction published by H.P. Lovecraft. I'm drawn to prose that is richly descriptive, narratives that incorporate magical or supernatural elements, mystery, and all-around evocative writing that's easy to get lost in. Here's a list of what I'm currently reading and some awesome titles I recently finished that I can't stop talking about.</p>

              </figure>
              <p>Paper Girls is an ongoing comics series about a group of misfit girls that stumble upon a rift in time on their paper route the day after Halloween in 1984. It's an awesome YA pick with strong female characters who accidentally confront alternate versions of themselves. There's also aliens. I really like this series, and it's brand new which means once you're caught up with the latest issue (I think there's 7 to date?) you have to wait a month for the next one to come out (literally forcing you to run over to your local comic book store to pick it up).</p>

              </figure>
              <p>Hitchcock and Bradbury Fistfight in Heaven is one of the coolest collections of short stories I've ever come across. It's a compilation of two anthrologies put together by Alfred Hitchcock and Ray Bradbury and then combined and edited into a sort of mega-anthology by Dave Eggers. I think it's pretty unique in this respect, since we have curation happening on three different levels (and who wouldn't want to read hand-picked stories from two of the greatest storytellers ever?). Eggers also intersperses some contemporary sci fi writing by authors like China Mieville into the anthology.</p>

              </figure>
                <p>I just finished reading Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell and I am feeling so deprived! Luckily I follow the NYPL's reader services blog, Biblio File, and they have <a href="https://www.nypl.org/blog/2014/10/14/if-you-like-murakami">a page offering recommendations</a> for similar titles. I've heard a lot of folks comparing Suzanna Clarke's writing style to Tolkien, and I wouldn't say that's incorrect. She has a way of infusing detail into her settings that is both fantastical and historically-informed. Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, her first novel, is a period-piece that follows two rival magicians attempting to bring magic back to Victorian England. I loved this book because Clarke establishes an incredibly intricate mythos to accompany her story (kind of like the Silmarillion).</p>

              </figure>
              <p>Marvel 1602 is a perfect example of the kinds of comics I most enjoy discovering (and subsequently recommending). First of all, Neil Gaiman wrote it, so it's pretty safe to say that you'll be wowed. Secondly, the whole premise is basically, 'what if super heroes came into being during England's colonization of the New World?' So cool! The best part about this story was figuring out which characters corresponded to our modern superhero canon, like Thor and Spiderman. And for folks who aren't super familiar with comics, the story is just as enjoyable since it's a standalone maxi-series.</p>
